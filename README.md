ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal: The objective was to design a responsive movie and theater seat booking interface for Sugarland Theaters. The system visually displays seats, allows users to select available ones, and confirms the booking.

âœ… Solution Summary: I built a fully interactive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout dynamically generates the seating grid, reflects seat statuses (available, selected, occupied), and calculates pricing in real-time. All styling is responsive, making it usable across devices.

ðŸ§  My Approach:

HTML Structure: I started by creating a semantic layout for the header, main content, and control buttons.

CSS Styling: I used CSS Flexbox and custom classes to create a visually clear seat map, responsive layout, and intuitive booking UI.

JavaScript Logic: I used DOM manipulation to dynamically create seats, manage selection states, and calculate totals. I also added reset and confirm functions for real user interaction.

Testing and Refinement: I tested on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and fixed any logic bugs to make sure booking flow works smoothly.

ðŸ’¡ Why Itâ€™s Unique: I focused not only on functionality but also user experience â€” with clean layout, color-coded seats, and real-time updates. I aimed to make it both developer-friendly and user-friendly.
